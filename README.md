# SmartThings.NETCoreWebHookSDK

Currently just a first pass with 2 samples, one for ASP.Net Core Web API and one for an Azure Functions HttpTrigger.  Both samples allow for a very basic WebHook based SmartApp that uses a single-page configuration to display a single section with a boolean toggle.

I will expand on the README and tune the functionality once I port my favorite groovy based SmartApp using this SDK.  Of course I am also happy to take on contributors.  Please use the [issues feature in the repo](https://github.com/ianisms/SmartThings.NETCoreWebHookSDK/issues) to report any issues.
